				<div class="questions">
					<p class="question">In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</p>
					<p class="answer">My name is Hannah Riggs and I live in Waltham, MA. I received my BA in Dance with concentrations in both ballet and modern from Point Park University's Conservatory of Performing Arts. I currently work as a professional dancer with two companies: Fusionworks, a contemporary company, and Metamorphosis, a dance troupe that is a branch of TEN31 Productions. I also work as a living statue and character with TEN31 Productions. Finally, I also work in the STEM Division office at MassBay Community College as the STEM SSA Academic Program Coordinator. </p>
					<p class="question">Why are you taking this course?</p>
					<p class="answer">I am taking this course because I love web design and programming, and this sounded like a class where I could explore and grow those two interests. Although I have seen sites built similarly to the way sites will be built in this class and feel comfortable creating sites using plain HTML/CSS/JS and sites using content management systems, I would love to actually feel comfortable and confident creating robust PHP sites of my own. Finally, I am pursuing the Master of Liberal Arts, Digital Media Design graduate degree here at the Harvard Extension. This will be my fifth course. </p>
					<p class="question">What previous experience do you have with programming?</p>
					<p class="answer">My favorite programming language is Java! I have taken a few classes focusing on data structures and software design using this language. I also have some experience with C, JavaScript and Python via classes and my own self-study. I look forward to start working on some of my own programming projects soon outside of my classes. </p>
					<p class="question">Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</p>
					<p class="answer">I am working on a Linux machine. My text editor of choice is the open source Bluefish Editor if there are any fellow open source lovers out there. </p>
					<p class="question">Anything else we should know?</p>
					<p class="answer">Besides dancing, programming and web design, my other interests include video games, travel, literature and outreach work with kids. I am looking forward to continuing this class; I can tell it will be a fun, challenging and rewarding experience! </p>
